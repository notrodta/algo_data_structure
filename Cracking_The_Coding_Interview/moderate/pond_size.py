# Pond Sizes: You have an integer matrix representing a plot of land, where the value at that loca­ tion represents the height above sea level. A value of zero indicates water. A pond is a region of water connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The size of the pond is the total number of connected water cells. Write a method to compute the sizes of all ponds in the matrix.

# EXAMPLE
# Input:
# 0210
# 0101
# 1101
# 0101
# Output: 2, 4, 1 (in any order)
